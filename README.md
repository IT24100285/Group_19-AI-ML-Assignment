**Overview of the project**

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the optimal crop production to cultivate based on various agricultural parameters such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), climate conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH. This Progress Review I focuses on the critical stages of data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).



**Dataset details**

Dataset Name: crop_yeild_dataset

Source: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sparshx/crop-yeild-dataset/data

Description: The dataset contains 250000 instances and 11 features. The target variable is production (in tons), which represents the crop yield for a given set of conditions. The input features include numerical values for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, as well as the crop name (e.g., 'rice', 'maize', 'cotton'), which is a crucial categorical feature for predicting yield.
